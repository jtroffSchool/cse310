# Overview

My game is a simple card battling game about cats. Each side has 4 cats chosen at random and you use energy to attack or use items. You click on the cat you want to attack and select attack. You then click on the enemies cat that you want to attack. Each cat can only attack once per turn. You can also drag an item to one of your cats to apply its affect for the energy cost.

My purpose in writing this software was to gain a greater appreciation of what goes on behind the scenes of the games that I like to play. I also wanted to expand my python knowledge.

# Future Work

- I want to improve the graphics and layout so that it isn't so basic. I want to add more of a background and some uniqueness to each of the cards.
- I want to add several more cats, passive abilites that will affect gameplay, and more balance fixes.
- I want to add unique sound effects that go with each cat and item.
